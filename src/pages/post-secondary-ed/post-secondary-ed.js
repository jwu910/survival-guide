          <h1>Post Secondary Education</h1>
          <p>
            It’s no surprise that thinking about the future can be scary, especially when you consider what life is like
            after high school and you start to wonder what attaining a post-secondary education really means. Most
            people will use the terms university and college interchangeably so much so that it is hard to differentiate
            between the two as they can both be private or public institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is the difference between private and public institutions? Private institutions are self-funded using
            tuition and endowments while public institutions receive funds from the government. This means that private
            institutions are more likely to be selective in their admissions process, have smaller class sizes,
            resulting in smaller student-teacher ratio. With public institutions, they are more likely to offer a wider
            range of courses and majors to explore.
          </p>

          <h2>University vs College</h2>
          <p>
            Universities are usually large state institutions, the most well-known ones are ivy-leagues, and are
            required to have graduate school programs (Masters and PhD degrees) . While colleges are still a form of
            higher education, like community college, these institutions can offer two year associate degrees and/or
            four year bachelor degrees. The main differences are that colleges are usually smaller and can be dedicated
            to specific focuses or offer broader studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for a college to reach the university status they must meet specific requirements for at least five
            years. These requirements include (Elmhurst University, 2020):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Having a separate undergraduate and graduate studies program</li>
            <li>The graduate programs must lead to an advanced degrees in at least three academic fields</li>
            <li>The school must also be accredited by being certified from an accrediting agency</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Community College</h2>
          <p>
            Community college is a type of college that offers two year programs that can lead to an Associate degree in
            the Arts or Sciences. This is an option that is significantly cheaper when comparing it to other types of
            colleges and universities. Not only do community colleges have a broad range of classes but they also
            usually have an open access policy so they will typically accept most applicants.
          </p>
          <p>
            The credits that you take at community college may also be transferable to fulfilling requirements for a
            four year bachelor program, whether it be at a college or university. Community college is a great choice if
            you are unsure about pursuing post-secondary education but it also gives you the opportunity to keep the
            door open for further expanding your education and working towards a bachelor’s degree, if you so choose.
          </p>

          <h2>Study Abroad Programs</h2>
          <p>
            Many colleges and universities have study abroad programs, the length of the program is dependent on the
            institution so you could be going abroad for a semester, a quarterly program in the middle of the academic
            or even in the summer. This is a great opportunity for students to learn about different cultures, learn a
            new language, further enhance their language skills, or gain unique experiences and learn in a new
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application process generally varies depending on the institution, but requirements to keep in mind when
            applying are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Having a valid passport and/or visa</li>
            <li>Filling out the application</li>
            <li>Maintaining a certain academic requirement (ie. having a minimum GPA range)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Students should keep in mind that studying abroad can be quite costly when considering travel fees but most
            institutions also provide scholarship applications and there are also external organizations that offer
            scholarships. It is never too early to start considering whether studying abroad is a program that you would
            be interested in pursuing and to ensure that you have a solid plan before applying because it may delay your
            graduation.
          </p>

          <h2>Trade School</h2>
          <p>
            Trade school is an institution of higher education that trains students specific career and technical
            skills. This differs from colleges and universities as it provides a more hands on learning/training process
            and has a more specific education path, this also means that the length of training is typically shorter and
            can last from a few months up to two years (Midwest Technical Institute, 2018).
          </p>
          <h3>Types of Trade Schools</h3>
          <p>
            With skilled trades there are specific skills that must be developed to perform the job well. This means
            that the job may need specific certifications or tests that the student must pass, which is where trade
            school comes in to help develop these skills. Some careers that are associated with skilled trades school
            are truck driving, information technology (IT), as well as plumbing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mechanical trades offer education programs for careers that are related to operating some kind of system of
            machinery. These careers include electrician, mechanics, and welding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allied health is a type of trade school that educates students who are interested in becoming health
            professionals that assist in the health care system. For example, careers such as dental hygienists,
            sonographers as well as physical therapists.
          </p>

          <h2>Workshops, Bootcamps and Training Certificate</h2>
          <p>
            Workshops are educational programs that help prepare individuals for professional development and are
            usually held in group settings that allow students to interact with others to achieve specific goals. This
            is not only limited to students but is also applicable for anyone who is willing to better develop any
            professional skills (ie. a current employee may enroll in a workshop that their employer is offering on
            bettering their public speaking skills).
          </p>
          <p>
            Institutions can also hold workshops for students whether it be in-person or virtually and can usually be
            found online. Workshops are a great way to meet new people to create connections as well as learn more about
            specific aspects of careers that they may be interested in pursuing.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also bootcamps which are condensed training programs that are composed of courses, self-studying
            and teach real world skills for professional careers. They are especially prominent for technology fields
            like software development.Bootcamps are likely to award participants with a certificate of completion which
            is great for those who want to learn skills quickly or have something that shows employers/recruiters that
            they have developed certain skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also an application process that can come with bootcamps and they can range in length of several
            months. It is also a good decision to see how accredited the bootcamps is and ask around to try to find
            people who have already partaken in the bootcamps and gauge their experiences and whether it may be
            beneficial for you in the long-term (ie. when job hunting).
          </p>
          <p>
            Training certificate programs are also a different kind of educational program that can range from six
            months to two years and can certify you for specific on-demand jobs like becoming a firefighter, brick
            mason, air traffic controller or an emergency medical technician.
          </p>
          <p>
            These programs can lead to you getting a job faster and being able to move up the ranks through the
            certification in the respective field. The environment is much more fast-paced and rigorous, similar to
            bootcamps, as it teaches specific workplace skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall all three of these programs have their own benefits when comparing them to colleges and
            universities, especially if you are considering changing careers or want to gain credentials fast. For those
            interested in the technology field, bootcamps and gaining certifications may be particularly engaging.
          </p>

          <h2>How to choose what kind of post-secondary education is best for you?</h2>
          <p>
            This is definitely not an easy decision and there are various factors that an individual must consider
            before making their choice. These factors include:
          </p>
          <h3>Financial situation</h3>
          <p>
            Attaining a post-second university can be especially expensive but there are also lots of financial aids
            that are applicable whether it be through the government, scholarships and other financial resources that
            can help ease the financial burden that is associated with post-secondary education.
          </p>
          <h3>Timeline</h3>
          <p>
            Do you have a specific time frame in mind for when you want to start your career? The options listed above,
            all having varying time ranges for the education path that you may consider pursuing ranging from a couple
            of months to several years, so it is also important to take this into consideration when making your choice.
          </p>
          <h3>Career Interests</h3>
          <p>
            Are you interested in pursuing a career in a specific field? Or are you hoping to make a decision after you
            are able to gauge some of your options, then picking an institution that offers a broad range of studies may
            be a better fit. Just because you made a decision does not mean you are completely committed to it or have
            to follow through. Lots of people end up taking unique paths to end up in a career that they like and are
            able to thrive in.
          </p>
          <h3>Preferences</h3>
          <p>
            Are you planning on staying local and close to home? Are you interested in living in a different country or
            city that you want to explore? Do you prefer having smaller class sizes to get to know your teachers better
            or create deeper connections? Are you interested in finding clubs to join that allow you to meet new people
            and lets you explore your interests? These are all questions that you should be asking yourself before
            coming to a decision as to where you want to study as well as the kind of institution that best suits your
            needs. Some resources that can help you make your decision would be talking to your parents or reaching out
            to a counselor or mentor who is in the career path that you are interested in pursuing.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '16px' }}>Ultimately, the decision is up to you!</p>
